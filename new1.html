                    Store after store selling glasses along the streets.

                    I search in vain for glasses good against space and time.

                    Lenses to nullify the absolute sovereignty of distances

                    and bring to me clear images of the past.

                    My eyes struggle to disinter Manaus,

                    that vast roofless market, that open-air garage.

                    Here and there icebergs of neoclassical profile:

                    the theater’s cupola, the high facade of a palace,

                    but vertical slabs quickly block the view

                    and a raw explosion of color comes to mask

                    the facades of somber buildings dressed in aging grayish-green.

                    I look for a discreet shop, the reserve of the lost

                    province, where one entered through high and narrow doors

                    asking for merchandise from people whom one knew.

                    All without the slightest gaudiness, no blatant posters,

                    no loudspeakers and their strident bellowing.

                    I look for a quiet hidden face from long before this chaos,

                    Carnival follies of just three fleeting days,

                    the pleasant corner where there reigned a silence

                    broken only by the sound of bells and streetcars on their tracks.

                    None of the savage roar of endless traffic

                    nor of the anonymous crowd parading by without a face.

                    Now I can barely take a step, the sidewalks blocked by cars

                    and street stalls bursting with electronic implements.

                    I stop short: startled by the tough tenacity

                    of green: at last I see licania, ficus, mango and papaya trees.

                    They all proclaim the miracle, fruit of fertile rains.

                    For years they’ve grown, but stunted in the shadow of

                    those stationary herds of exotic elephants.

                    I look in vain for channels flowing under bridges

                    carrying along riverbanks, branches, trunks, leaves.

                    No longer canoes, rolling wakes, waterlogged calabash,

                    nor floating shacks, houses on stilts, shoots of swamp grass.

                    Just malodorous debris, gangrenous pools of mud,

                    shacks made of scraps, zinc sheeting, residue, miseria.

                    Of the submerged, almost extinct, humiliated waters,

                    only a covering of underbrush reveals the hidden moisture.

                    To see the city once again, I shut my eyes.

                    They’ve already taken our hide

                    and our blood,

                    they’ve already raffled off our land

                    with all its sacred names

                    (and left it stripped to the bone).

                    Insatiable, now they trade us in

                    for beef.

                    No to the sap of agro-business!

                    No to a fate of agro-death!

                    No to Kindle in a world without kin!

                    The flora moans,

                    the fauna moans,

                    the mercury-rich river moans.

                    It is the forest that clothes the Indian.

                    Leave us the little that remains!

                    Flowers cannot sprout from flames.

                    Anger is a brief madness, Horace

                    Amazonia turned into the biggest bonfire in the world.

                    The Alps and the Andes were converted into chasms.

                    The seas and the eyes that looked upon them evaporated.

                    On the tree of life, the bird that sang the four hundred

                    voices of blue faded into the flames.

                    Of all creatures, human eyes had the deepest pits.

                    Suddenly, it was night on earth.

                    A searing silence came over all.

                    The most orphaned of beings was the son of man.

                    Old as the moon was the baby’s face.

                    Eons dissolved into instants.

                    Somewhere, at some moment

                    a deranged Godzilla and a maddened Batman

                    pitched nuclear strikes at one another.

                    All of it was brief.

                    The Apocalypse shall be the work of man, not of God.
